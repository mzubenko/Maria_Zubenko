# Maria_Zubenko Selenium Hometask

This is a SpecFlow Visual Studio Project, so it requires a SpecFlow extension for VS. You can install it by following instructions via the link: https://docs.specflow.org/projects/getting-started/en/latest/GettingStarted/Step1.html

In order for this project to work you need the following packages installed: NUnit, NUnit.ConsoleRunner, NUnit3TestAdapter, Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk, Selenium.Support, Selenium.WebDriver, Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver (or something else, depending on your browser).

Make sure to install the version of Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver (or any other web browser driver), that is compatible with your web browser!!!

To run this project you may open Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and go to the menu "Test" -> "Run all tests". Or you may as well use Solution Explorer. To open it go to the menu "View" -> "Solution Explorer". It is also possible to run it from the cmd: you will need to enter a folder with the project using "cd" command and run the tests using "dotnet test" command

Note: I had problems uploading code to a remote repository, therefore this branch wasn't initially ceated from the main branch, so it doesn't have a .gitignore file
